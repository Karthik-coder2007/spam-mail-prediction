Spam Mail Prediction using Logistic Regression:
This project implements a Spam Email Classifier using Logistic Regression, a popular machine learning algorithm for binary classification. The model predicts whether an email is Spam or Not Spam (Ham) based on the email content.

Spam emails are unsolicited messages that often contain advertisements, scams, or malicious links. This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Logistic Regression to classify emails accurately.
